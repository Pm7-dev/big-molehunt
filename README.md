# big-molehunt
aka Molehunt Teams  


This plugin is not on modrinth for a reason!! I will not be polishing it for a real 'release' and as consequence this project may be very buggy if you do not use it in exactly its intended cases.  
Usage:  
modify the plugin's config.yml file if you want to change the default player spread distance when the game starts.   

to start the game, first get exactly 16 players online. This plugin does not support any other player count. You can try it with fewer players, but I don't know what will happen.  

Once your players are online, run /startmolehunt, which will run the team and mole selections in time  

moles can use /molemsg <message> to message their fellow moles, while teams can just use /teammsg  
 
/starttimer can be used to start a timer that claims the end is accessible after it ends. Nothing actually happens when the timer is done, but in the videos piffin runs a setblock command lol.   
I believe you can edit the config to set "preTime" to be the time (in minutes) that the timer lasts.
